    <h2>🏠 Introduction and Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Kingdom Children’s Home is a vision birthed out of compassion and divine calling — a desire to provide a safe, loving, and godly environment for orphaned, abandoned, and vulnerable children in our community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the home is not yet physically established, the burden is clear: to raise a generation grounded in hope, love, and godliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This initiative is an extension of the mission of Power of Jesus International Church, where we believe that true religion is caring for widows and orphans in their distress (James 1:27). We are currently mobilizing resources, building partnerships, and trusting God to bring this vision to life — one child, one helping hand, and one prayer at a time.

    <h2>🎯 Our Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide shelter, food, clothing, and basic needs to children who lack a stable and safe living environment.</li>
      <li>Offer access to education and healthcare, ensuring every child grows up with the opportunity to thrive mentally and physically.</li>
      <li>Instill biblical values, spiritual guidance, and character development through discipleship and teaching.</li>
      <li>Empower children through mentorship and skills training, preparing them to be responsible, productive, and godly members of society.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🛤 How We Started (The Vision Journey)</h2>
    <p>
      The vision for Kingdom Children’s Home was conceived in prayer and observation of the growing number of vulnerable children in our region. Moved by love and guided by faith, we began sharing this burden with fellow believers and community members.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may not yet have buildings or beds, but we have the most important foundation — the conviction to act and the heart to serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our prayer is that with the support of well-wishers, donors, churches, and volunteers, this dream will become a reality — a sanctuary of love and transformation.
    </p>

    <h2>📅 A Day in the Life (Our Hope for the Future)</h2>
    <p>We envision a typical day at Kingdom Children’s Home to look like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Morning devotion and prayer</li>
      <li>Nutritious meals and clean living conditions</li>
      <li>School attendance or learning activities on site</li>
      <li>Mentorship sessions, playtime, and skills training</li>
      <li>Evening fellowship and bible study</li>
      <li>Rest in a safe, warm, and peaceful environment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We look forward to capturing and sharing such moments once the home is operational — through photos, videos, and stories that reflect God’s faithfulness.
